# react-signup-form

## Description

This sign-up form uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Formik in React and is fully functional. I used JavaScript to validate the entire form before it was submitted, formik and JavaScript to modify error messages, and attributes on the input fields to validate the form's inputs. Devices such as desktop, mobile, and tablet computers can all use the form.

### Built With

HTML<br>
CSS<br>
Java Script<br>
Formkik<br>
Sweetalert<br>
React<br>

#### Formik:
Formik takes care of the repetitive and annoying stuff—keeping track of values/errors/visited fields, orchestrating validation, and handling submission—so you don't have to. This means you spend less time wiring up state and change handlers


##### Sweetalert
SweetAlert is a method to customize alerts in your applications, websites and games.
